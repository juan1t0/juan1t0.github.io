This project studies how large language models and knowledge graph reasoning can improve spatiotemporal forecasting pipelines.

## Scope

- Review methods for spatiotemporal forecasting, LLM integration, and knowledge graph reasoning.
- Design workflows for using external context in forecasting.
- Build data curation pipelines from heterogeneous sources.

## Current Work

- Building reproducible preprocessing pipelines.
- Defining benchmark tasks for context-aware forecasting.
- Evaluating how knowledge graph signals help forecast quality and interpretability.

## Status

In progress (July 2025 - Present).
