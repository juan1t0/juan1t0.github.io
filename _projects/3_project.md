This project developed a visual analytics system to explore and explain spatiotemporal anomalies in crime data.

## What Was Built

- Spatiotemporal graph modeling of crime records.
- STARMA-based anomaly detection workflow.
- Interactive front-end in d3.js for anomaly exploration.
- LLM-assisted external context retrieval to connect anomalies with events and news.

## Outcome

- Research article accepted at SIBGRAPI 2025.
- System used for visual inspection and explanation of anomalous behavior over time and space.

## Timeline

February 2025 - August 2025.
