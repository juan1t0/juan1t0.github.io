This long-running project applies graph-based deep learning to forecast spatiotemporal signals, with emphasis on crime data and sparse hotspot dynamics.

## Main Contributions

- Applied geometric deep learning and state-of-the-art forecasting models on graph nodes.
- Reached over 90% overall accuracy in broad scenarios.
- Identified persistent performance gaps for sparse local hotspots (below 40% in difficult settings).

## Ongoing Directions

- Hypergraph-based formulations for richer relational structure.
- Multi-resolution and U-Net-like architectures for local detail recovery.
- Error analysis focusing on high-variance and low-density regions.

## Status

In progress (July 2023 - Present).
