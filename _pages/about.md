I am a PhD student in data science, currently affiliated with the [Visual Data Science Lab]() at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the supervision of [Prof. Jorge Poco](). I hold a full doctoral scholarship from FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation) in the Direct Doctoral modality.

My work focuses on spatiotemporal data analysis and visual analytics, with particular interest in geometric deep learning and explainable AI.

Previously, I was a researcher in the RUTAS project at Universidad Católica San Pablo (UCSP) in Arequipa, Peru, where I worked on computer vision and multimodal deep learning. I hold a BSc in Computer Science (2021) from the Computer Science Department at UCSP.
